# Amazon-Clone


This is an amazon clone that utilizes the full MERN stack as well as the React Context API. I also have Stripe setup for (non-activated) payment processing!

I was able to complete this clone with help from Pradhuman Patel's torial video (link here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojy2q3YJ9dE&list=PLVvE_h2Ej0miw_CZboXpAn9PRvPVqAIoN)

Pradhuman is an excellent instructor and is very easy to follow! 

Once I completed the tutorial, Imade several updates and changes to enhance the app and make the code even easier tofollow! This includes:
  - Separating out the CSS
  - UI changes like better formatted pictures and hover effects on buttons
  - Deploying onto Firebase
  
This project is an excellent e-commerce app to build that will get you very familiar with the MERN stack, the React Context API, and Stripe. Enjoy!
